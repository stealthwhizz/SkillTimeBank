# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gig Lifecycle system manages the complete workflow of gig posts from creation through completion or cancellation. It implements a state machine with specific transitions (OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → AWAITING_CONFIRMATION → COMPLETED|CANCELLED) and handles edge cases like race conditions, duplicate confirmations, and user departures.

## Glossary

- **Gig_Lifecycle**: The complete workflow managing gig states and transitions
- **Gig_State**: Current status of a gig (OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, AWAITING_CONFIRMATION, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- **State_Transition**: Movement from one gig state to another following defined rules
- **Race_Condition**: Multiple users attempting to accept the same gig simultaneously
- **Dual_Confirmation**: Process requiring both poster and helper to confirm completion
- **Atomic_Write**: Database operation that completes entirely or not at all
- **Optimistic_UI**: User interface that shows expected results before server confirmation
- **TimeBank_System**: The complete community timebank application
- **User_Account**: A registered user with balance, reputation, and gig history
- **TimeCredits (TC)**: The local currency where 1 TC = 1 hour of work

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to create gigs with proper validation, so that only valid gigs enter the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a gig, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL validate that the title is not empty and contains fewer than 200 characters
2. WHEN a user creates a gig, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL validate that the description is not empty and contains fewer than 2000 characters
3. WHEN a user creates a gig, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL validate that the TimeCredits amount is greater than 0
4. WHEN a user creates a FIND_HELP gig, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL verify the user's balance is greater than or equal to the offered TC amount
5. WHEN a valid gig is created, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL increment the poster's gigsPosted counter

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to accept available gigs safely, so that race conditions and invalid acceptances are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to accept a gig, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL verify the gig status is OPEN
2. WHEN a user attempts to accept a gig, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL verify the user is not the gig poster
3. WHEN a user accepts an OPEN gig, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL set the acceptedBy field to the current user's username
4. WHEN a user accepts an OPEN gig, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL change the status to IN_PROGRESS using atomic write operations
5. IF multiple users attempt to accept the same OPEN gig simultaneously, THEN THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL allow only the first acceptance and reject subsequent attempts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a gig participant, I want a dual confirmation process, so that both parties agree the work is completed before payment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the first participant marks an IN_PROGRESS gig as complete, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL change the status to AWAITING_CONFIRMATION
2. WHEN the second participant confirms completion, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL execute the payment transfer
3. WHEN payment is executed, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL change the status to COMPLETED
4. WHEN a gig reaches COMPLETED status, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL record the completedAt timestamp
5. IF a user attempts to confirm the same gig multiple times, THEN THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL ignore subsequent confirmation requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a gig poster, I want to cancel gigs when appropriate, so that I can manage my posted gigs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a gig poster attempts to cancel an OPEN gig, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL change the status to CANCELLED
2. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL prevent cancellation of gigs in IN_PROGRESS status by regular users
3. WHERE moderator privileges are present, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL allow cancellation of IN_PROGRESS gigs
4. WHEN a gig is cancelled, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL record the cancellation timestamp
5. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL prevent cancellation attempts by users who are not the gig poster

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want robust handling of edge cases, so that the system remains stable under unusual conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF two helpers attempt to accept the same gig simultaneously, THEN THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL use atomic operations to ensure only one acceptance succeeds
2. IF a user attempts to confirm completion without prior acceptance, THEN THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL reject the confirmation and display an error message
3. IF a user attempts to cancel a gig after it has been accepted, THEN THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL prevent the cancellation unless moderator privileges are present
4. IF a user attempts repeated confirmations of the same gig, THEN THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL ignore duplicate requests without processing additional payments
5. IF a poster leaves the subreddit during an active gig, THEN THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL maintain the gig state and allow completion by the helper

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback on gig status, so that I understand what actions are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL display status chips that clearly indicate the current gig state
2. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL disable action buttons when the corresponding action is not valid for the current state
3. WHEN a user performs an action, THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL show optimistic UI updates immediately
4. IF an optimistic UI update fails server validation, THEN THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL rollback the interface to the previous state
5. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL provide clear error messages when actions are rejected

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that all state transitions and edge cases are validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL include unit tests for all state transition functions
2. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL include integration tests that verify complete workflows from creation to completion
3. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL capture state snapshots before and after each transition for testing validation
4. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL test all edge cases including race conditions and invalid state transitions
5. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL maintain test coverage above 90% for all lifecycle management code

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable state management, so that gig data integrity is maintained under all conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL use atomic write operations for all state transitions
2. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL validate state transitions before applying changes
3. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL maintain referential integrity between gigs and user accounts
4. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL log all state transitions with timestamp and user context
5. THE Gig_Lifecycle SHALL recover gracefully from partial failures and maintain consistent state
